Followed the 6 step methodologyu of CRISP Data Mining process:

1) Business Understanding
Claims costs XPO Logistics $90 Million+ every year. 
The project was divided into 3 different sub parts:
-- Prediction of closed Claim Value: How much the business should keep aside for thier claims on a monthly basis?
-- NMFC Class Analysis: Which NMFC class shipments are leading to losses. Usually customers pay extra charge for excess liability coverage and n case of damage claim back amounts
-- Throughput calculations: Analysing the number of claims closed, $ amount closed and the average age to close for different segments of Claim amounts weekly basis

2) Data understanding:
CLaims are categorized into 5 buckets: 0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120+ days.
If the claim goes into the final bucket of 120+ dyas, they have to be written as deductible in the balance sheet of the company.
The main aim is to prevent any new claim going into that bucket and resolve/settle them as soon as possible.
Claims are caused when a damage occurs due to a fault of XPO Logistics and the customer wants their money back.
